**构造程序抽象 Building Abstractions with Procedures**

# 名言
The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are chiefly these three：
1. Combining several simple ideas into one compound one, and thus all complex ideas are made. 
2. The second is bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex, together, and setting them by one another so as to take a view of them at once, without uniting them into one, by which it gets all its ideas of relations. 
3. The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real existence: this is called **abstraction**。

# Abstraction
- 抽象：*从现实具体中抽取出代表性的统一概念(conception)，并用概念代表具体*。如用一个名称指代一个 object，指代一个具体 procedure。
- Data：*为复合对象命名，并当作一个单元(unit)去操作*；
- Procedure：不关心 Procedure 细节，只关注其代表的概念(conception)，如 `square` procedure 表示计算*数的平方*；
