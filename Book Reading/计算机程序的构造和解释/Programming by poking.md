#SICP #Fundamental-Of-Programing
Sussman and Abelson, author of \<SICP>

Sussman said that in the 80s and 90s, engineers built complex systems by combining simple and well-understood parts. *The goal of SICP was to provide the abstraction language for reasoning about such systems*.

Sussman pointed out that engineers now routinely write code for complicated hardware that they don’t fully understand (and often can’t understand because of trade secrecy.) The same is true at the software level, since *programming environments consist of gigantic libraries with enormous functionality*.

*He said that programming today is “More like science. You grab this piece of library and you poke at it.*

The *“analysis-by-synthesis”* view of SICP ：where you *build a larger system out of smaller, simple parts*。
