2. Main program asks the database object to find the set of shapes（Collection 对象保存 shapes）
3. Main program asks the collection to sort the shapes.
4. Main program asks the collection to display the shapes.
5. The collection asks each shape it contains to display itself.
6. Each shape displays itself (using the Display object) according to the type of shape I have.
