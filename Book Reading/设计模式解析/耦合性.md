# Coupling
**The strength of a connection between two routines.**

- Coupling is a complement（make-up 补充） to cohesion. 
- Cohesion describes how strongly the internal contents of a routine are related to each other. 
- Coupling describes how strongly a routine is related to other routines. 


The goal is to create routines with **internal integrity (strong cohesion) and small, direct, visible, and flexible relations** to other routines (loose coupling).
