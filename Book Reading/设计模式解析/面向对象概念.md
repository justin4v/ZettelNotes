| *Abstract class* | Abstract classes define what a set of related classes can do. |
| *Class* | Defines the types of objects based on the responsibilities these objects have. <br>Responsibilities can be divided into behavior and/or state. These can be implemented using methods and/or data, respectively.|
| *Concrete Class* | A class that implements a particular type of behavior for an abstract class. Concrete classes are specific, nonchanging implementations of a concept.|
| *Encapsulation* | Typically defined as data hiding, but better thought of as any kind of hiding (type, implementation, design, and so on).|
| *Inheritance*| A class inherits from another class when it receives some or all of the qualities of that class.The starting class is called the base, super, parent, or generalized class, whereas the inheriting class is called the derived, sub, child, or specialized class.|
| *Instance* | A particular example of a class. (It is always an object.) A particular instance or entity of a class.Each object has its own state. This enables me to have several objects of the same type (class).  |
| *Instantiation*| An interface is like a class, but only provides a specification–and not an implementation–for its members. It is similar to an abstract class consisting only of abstract members. When programming, you use interfaces when you need several classes to share some characteristics that are not present in a common base class and want to be sure that each class implements the characteristic on its own (because each member is abstract). |
| *Perspectives* | There are three different perspectives for looking at objects: conceptual, specification, and implementation. <br>These distinctions are helpful in understanding the relationship between abstract classes and their derivations. The abstract class defines how to solve things conceptually. It also gives the specification for communicating with any object derived from it. Each derivation provides the specific implementation needed. |
| *Polymorphism* | Being able to refer to different derivations of a class in the same way, but getting the behavior appropriate to the derived class being referred to. |
