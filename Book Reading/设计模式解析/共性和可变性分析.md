# 共性和可变性
Commonality analysis seeks structure that is unlikely to change over time, while variability analysis captures structure that is likely to change. 
Variability analysis makes sense only in terms of the context defined by the associated commonality analysis

# 找到对象新方式
Often the new object-oriented designer is told to begin by looking in the problem domain: “Identify the nouns present, and create objects representing them. 

Then, find the verbs relating to those nouns (that is, their actions) and implement them by adding methods to the objects.” 

This process of focusing on nouns and verbs typically leads to larger class hierarchies than we might want.

*using commonality and variability analysis* as a primary tool in creating objects is a better approach than looking at just nouns and verbs.

## 使用抽象类的优点

|   和 abstract class 的对应关系 | 描述 |
| :-----------: | :-----------: |
|*Abstract class vs. the central binding concept* | An abstract class represents the core concept that binds together all the derivatives of the class. This core concept is what defines the commonality.|
|Commonality vs. which abstract classes to use|The commonalities define the abstract classes I need to use|
|Variations vs. derivation of an abstract class|The variations identified within that commonality become derivations of the abstract classes|
|Specification vs. interface for abstract class|The interface for these classes corresponds to the specification level.|


## 设计的两个步骤
| 定义...时 | 要问自己的问题 |
| :-----------: | :-----------: |
|An abstract class (commonality)|What interface is needed to handle all the responsibilities of this class?|
|Derived classes|Given this particular implementation (this variation), how can I implement it with the given specification?|
