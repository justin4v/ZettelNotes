# 共性和可变性
Commonality analysis seeks structure that is unlikely to change over time, while variability analysis captures structure that is likely to change. 
Variability analysis makes sense only in terms of the context defined by the associated commonality analysis

# 找到对象新方式
Often the new object-oriented designer is told to begin by looking in the problem domain: “Identify the nouns present, and create objects representing them. 

Then, find the verbs relating to those nouns (that is, their actions) and implement them by adding methods to the objects.” 

This process of focusing on nouns and verbs typically leads to larger class hierarchies than we might want.

*using commonality and variability analysis* as a primary tool in creating objects is a better approach than looking at just nouns and verbs.
