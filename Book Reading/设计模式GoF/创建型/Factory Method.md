#Design-Pattern
# Intent
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to
instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
# Also Known As
Virtual Constructor

# Motivation 
Frameworks use abstract classes to define and maintain relationships between objects. A framework is often responsible for creating these objects as well. 

Consider a framework for applications that can present multiple documents to the user. Two key abstractions in this framework are the classes Application and Document. 

Both classes are abstract, and clients have to subclass them to realize their application-specific implementations. To create a drawing application, for example,we define the classes DrawingApplication and DrawingDocument.

The Application classis responsible for managing Documents and will create them as required—when the user selects Open or New from a menu, for example. Because the particular Document subclass to instantiate is application-specific,the Application class can't predict the subclass of Document to instantiate—the Application class only knows when a new document should be created, not what kind of Document to create. This creates a dilemma: The framework must instantiate classes, but it only knows about abstract classes, which it cannot instantiate. The Factory Method pattern offers a solution. It encapsulates the knowledge of which Document subclass to create and moves this knowledge out of the framework

Application subclasses redefine an abstract CreateDocument operation on Application to return the appropriate Document subclass.
Once an Application subclass is instantiated, it can then instantiate application-specific Documents without knowing their class. We call CreateDocument a factory method because it's responsible for "manufacturing" an object.

# Applicability 
Use the Factory Method pattern when 
- a class can't anticipate the class of objects it must create. 
- a class wants its subclasses to specify the objectsit creates. 
- classes delegate responsibility to one of several helper subclasses, and you want to localize the knowledge of which helper subclass is the delegate.
