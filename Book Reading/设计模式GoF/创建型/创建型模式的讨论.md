# Parameterize System
There are two common ways to parameterize a system by the classes of objects it creates. 

## Subclass
One way is to **subclass the class** that creates the objects。
- This corresponds to using the Factory Method pattern. 
- The main drawback of this approach is that it can **require creating a new subclass just to change the class of the product**. Such changes can cascade（级联）. 
- For example,when the product creatorisitself created by a factory method, then you have to override its creator as well. 

## Object Composition
The other way to parameterize a system relies more on **object composition**: Define an object that's **responsible for knowing the class of the product objects**, and make it a parameter of the system. 

This is a key aspect of the *Abstract Factory, Builder, and Prototype* patterns. All three involve *creating a new "factory object"* whose responsibility is to create product objects. 
1. Abstract Factory has the factory object producing objects of several classes. 
2. Builder has the factory object building a complex product incrementally using a correspondingly complex protocol. 
3. Prototype has the factory object building a product by copying a prototype object. In this case, the factory object and the prototype are the same object, because the prototype is responsible for returning the product. 

## 比较
Consider the drawing editor framework described in the Prototype pattern. There are several ways to parameterize a GraphicToolby the class of product: 
- By applying the Factory Method pattern, a subclass of GraphicToolwill be created for each subclass of Graphic in the palette. 
	- GraphicTool will *have a New Graphic operation* that each GraphicTool subclass will redefine. 
- By applying the Abstract Factory pattern, there will be a class hierarchy of Graphics Factories, one for each Graphic subclass. Each factory creates just one product in this case:
	- CircleFactory will create Circles, LineFactory will create Lines, and so on.
	- A GraphicTool will *be parameterized with a factory for creating the appropriate kind* of Graphics. 
- By applying the Prototype pattern, each subclass of Graphics will implement the Clone operation, and a GraphicTool will *be parameterized with a prototype of the Graphic* it creates


# 使用
Which pattern is best depends on many factors.

In our drawing editor framework：
1. the Factory Method pattern is *easiest to use* at first. The main disadvantage here is that GraphicTool subclasses proliferate, and none of them does very much.
2. Abstract Factory *doesn't offer much of an improvement*, because it requires an equally large Graphics Factory class hierarchy. Abstract Factory would be preferable to Factory Method only if there were *already a GraphicsFactory class hierarchy*。
3.  Prototype pattern is probably the best for the drawing editor framework,because it *only requires implementing a Clone operation* on each Graphics class.

# 一般用法
- Factory Method makes a design more customizable and only a little more complicated.
- Other design patterns require new classes, whereas FactoryMethod only requires a new operation. 
- People often use FactoryMethod as the standard way to create objects.
- Designs that use Abstract Factory, Prototype, or Builder are *even more flexible* than those that use FactoryMethod, but they're also more complex. 
- Often, designs start out using FactoryMethod and evolve toward the other creational patterns as the designer discovers where more flexibility is needed.
