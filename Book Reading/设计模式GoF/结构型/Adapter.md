- Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. 
- Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
# Also Known As
Wrapper
# Motivation
Sometimes a toolkit class that's designed for reuse isn't reusable only because its interface doesn't match the domain-specific interface an application requires.
