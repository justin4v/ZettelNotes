设计模式及其分类如下：

![[设计模式及其分类.png]]

分类的原因：
1. The first criterion, called **purpose**, reflects **what a pattern does**. Patterns can have either creational, structural, or behavioral purpose. 
	1. Creational patterns concern the **process of object creation**. 
	2. Structural patterns deal with the **composition of classes or objects**. 
	3. Behavioral patterns characterize **the ways in which classes or objects interact(相互影响) and distribute(分配) responsibility**. 


2. The second criterion, called **scope**, specifies **whether the pattern applies primarily to classes or to objects**. 
	1. *Class patterns deal with relationships between classes and their subclasses*. These relationships are established through *inheritance*, so they are static—fixed at compile-time. 
	2. *Object patterns deal with object relationships*, which can be changed at run-time and are more dynamic. 
	3. *Almost all patterns use inheritance* to some extent. So the only patterns labeled "class patterns" are those that focus on class relationships. Note that most patterns are in the Object scope.
	4. Creational class patterns defer some part of object creation to subclasses, while Creational object patterns defer it to another object. 
	5. The Structural class patterns use inheritance to compose classes, while the Structural object patterns describe ways to assemble objects. The Behavioral class patterns use inheritance to describe algorithms and flow of control, whereas the Behavioral object patterns describe how a group of objects cooperate to perform a task that no single object can carry out alone

# 创建型
- [[Abstract Factory]]: Provide an interface for *creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes*. 
- [[Factory Method]]: Define an interface for creating an object, but *let subclasses decide which class to instantiate*. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
- [[Builder]]: *Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation* so that the same construction process can create different representations. 
- [[Prototype]]:  Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and *create new objects by copying this prototype*. 
- [[Singleton]]: Ensure *a class only has one instance*, and provide a global point of access to it. 

# 结构型
- [[Adapter]]:  *Convert the interface of a class into another interface* clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. 
- Bridge: *Decouple an abstraction from its implementation* so that the two can vary independently. 
- Composite: *Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies*. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. 
- Decorator: Attachadditional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. 
- Facade: Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interfacethat makes the subsystem easier to use. 
- Flyweight:  Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently. 
- [[Proxy]]: Provide a *surrogate(used instead of sb/sth else)* or placeholder for another object to control access to it. 


# 行为型
- [[Chain of Responsibility]]: Avoid coupling the sender of a request to itsreceiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it. 
- [[Command]]:  Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations. 
- Interpreter: Given a language, define a represention for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language. 
- Iterator: Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. 
- Observer:  Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. 
- State: Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class. 
- Strategy: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it. 
- Template Method: Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure. 
- [[Visitor]]: Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
