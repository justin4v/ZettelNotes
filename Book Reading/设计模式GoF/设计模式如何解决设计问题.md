# 设计模式解决的问题是什么
程序员写代码最好能最大限度的复用， 而复用的关键就是对新需求和已有需求发生变化的预见性，要求你的设计能够响应的改进

![[设计模式-需求变化示意.png]]
设计模式可以确保系统能够以特定方式变化， 避免重新设计， 同时保证系统的健壮性， 每个模块可以独立演进， 独立于其他方面

## 设计模式主要解决的8类问题

### 显示地指定一个类来创建对象

![[设计模式-显示指定类示意.png]]

问题： 在创建对象时指定类名，使得受特定实现的约束(只能使用某个具体的类),当未来我们要创建一个新的类对象的时候， 就需要修改我们所有使用指定类

方案： 间接的创建对象

模式： 使用抽象工厂、工厂方法等设计模式

### 依赖于特殊操作

![[设计模式-依赖特殊操作示意.png]]

问题： 为请求指定一个特殊操作时， 完成改请求的方式就固定下来， 写死了代码

方案： 在编译时或者运行时根据请求动态改变响应请求的方法

模式：责任链、命令模式

### 依赖于硬件和软件平台

![[设计模式-依赖特定平台.png]]

问题：不同平台操作系统接口和应用编程接口不同，依赖于特定平台的软件很难移植到其他平台

方案：设计系统时限制其平台相关性

模式：抽象工厂、桥接

## 依赖于对象表示或者实现



问题：知道对象怎样表示、保存、定位或者实现的客户端，在对象发生变化时也需要变化

方案：对客户隐藏这些设计

模式：抽象工厂、桥接模式、备忘录模式、代理模式

### 依赖于算法
![[设计模式-依赖特定算法.png]]

问题：算法在开发和复用时常常被扩展、优化和替代。依赖某个特定算法的对象，在算法变化是也需要修改

方案：将可能发生变化的算法独立

模式：建造者、迭代器、策略、模版方法、访问者

### 紧耦合
![[设计模式-紧耦合示意.png]]

问题：
- 紧耦合的类彼此相互依赖，很难独立的被复用；
- 必须理解其他类及其关系，才能改变一个类，很难移植和维护

方案：使用抽象耦合和分层技术提高系统的松散耦合性设计

模式： 抽象工厂、命令、门面、中介、观察者、责任链




### 依赖子类来扩充功能

![[设计模式-依赖子类扩充功能.png]]

问题：定义子类需要对父类有深入了解，子类还会导致类爆炸，因为简单的扩充也需要引入许多新的子类

方案：通过组合技术和具体的委托技术这种灵活的方式，可以定义子类，且将它的实例和已存在的实例进行组合引入定制的功能设计

模式：桥接、责任链、组合、装饰器、观察者、策略

### 不能方便的修改类

![[设计模式-不能方便修改类.png]]

问题：不得不修改一个难以修改的类饰，同时会要求修改许多其他子类

方案：直接对类进行功能增强，而不是修改类设计

模式：适配器、装饰器等

# GOF描述
## 1.确定适合的抽象
Design patterns help you **identify less-obvious abstractions and  objects** that can capture them. 
For example, *objects that represent a process or algorithm don't occur in nature, yet they are a crucial part of flexible designs*. 
- The Strategy pattern describes how to implement interchangeable families of algorithms. 
- The State pattern represents each state of an entity as an object.  

These objects are seldom found during analysis or even the early stages of design; they're discovered later in the course of making a design more flexible and reusable.

## 2.决定Object粒度
Objects can vary tremendously in size and number. They can represent everything down to the hardware or all the way up to entire applications. How do we decide what should be an object? 

Design patterns address this issue as well：
1. The Facade  pattern describes how to represent complete subsystems as objects,
2. Flyweight  pattern describes how to support huge numbers of objects at the finest granularities. 

Other design patterns describe specific ways of decomposing an object into smaller objects：
1. Abstract Factory  and Builder yield objectswhose only responsibilities are creatingother objects. 
2. Visitor  and Command yield objects whose only responsibilities are to implement a request on another object or group ofobjects.

## 3.明确对象接口
Specifying Objects Interfaces
### Type and Interface
Every operation declared by an object specifies the operation's name, the objects it takes as parameters, and the operation's return value. This is known as the operation's **signature**. 

**Interface**
The **set of all signatures defined by an object's operations** is called the **interface** to the object.

**Type**
A **type** is a name used to denote（refer） a particular interface.

### 动态绑定（Dynamic Binding）
- When a request issent to an object, the particular operation that'sperformed depends on both the *request* and the *receiving object*. **Different objects that support identical（same） requests may have different implementations of the operations that fulfill these requests.** 
- The run-time association of a request to an object and one of its operations is known as **dynamic binding**.
- Dynamic binding means that issuing a request doesn't commit you to a particular implementation until run-time. Consequently, you can write programs that expect an object with a particular interface, knowing that any object that has the correct interface will accept the request.

### 多态（polymorphism）
- dynamic binding lets you **substitute objects that have identical（same） interfaces for each other at run-time**. 
- This substitutability is known as **polymorphism**, and it's a key concept in object-oriented systems.
- polymorphism  lets a client object *make few assumptions* about other objects beyond supporting a particular interface. 
- Polymorphism *simplifies the definitions of clients, decouples objects from each other, and lets them vary their relationships to each other at run-time*.

### 设计模式的做法
Design patterns help you define interfaces by identifying their key elements and the kinds of data that getsent across an interface. A design pattern might also tell you what not to put in the interface. 
1. The Memento (283)pattern is a good example. It describes how to encapsulate and save the internal state of an object so that the object can be restored to that state later.

Design patterns also specify relationships between interfaces. In particular, they often require some classes to have similar interfaces,or they place constraints on the interfaces of some classes. 
For example
1. both Decorator and Proxy  require the interfaces of Decorator and Proxy objects to be identical to the decorated and proxied objects.
2. In Visitor , the Visitor interface must reflect all classes of objects that visitors can visit.

## 4.明确对象实现
### 类继承 vs. 接口继承
It's important to understand the difference between an object's class and its type. 
1. An object's class defines how the object is implemented. The class defines the object's internal state and the implementation of its operations ;
2. In contrast, an object's type only refers to its interface-.
3. An object can have many types, and objects of different classes can have the same type.
4. there's a close relationship between class and type. Because a class defines the operations an object can perform, it also defines the object's type. When we say that an object is an instance of a class, we imply that the object supports the interface defined by the class.

- Class inheritance **defines an object's implementation in terms of another object's implementation**. In short, it's a mechanism for **code and representation sharing**.
- In contrast, **interface inheritance** (or subtyping) describes *when an object can be used in place of another*.

#### 相关设计模式
Many ofthe design patterns depend on this distinction（class inheritance and interface inheritance）. For example:
1. objects in a Chain of Responsibility must have a common type, but usually they don't share a common implementation ;
2. In the Composite  pattern, Component defines a common interface, but Composite often defines a common implementation ;
3. Command , Observer , State , and Strategy  are often implemented with abstract classes that are pure interfaces.


## 5.复用机制
Most people can understand concepts like objects, interfaces,classes, and inheritance. The challenge lies in applying them to *build flexible, reusable software,* and design patterns can show you how.

### Inheritance vs. Composition
**class inheritance lets you define the implementation of one class(子类) in terms of another's（父类）**. 依照父类定义子类实现

Reuseby subclassing is often referred to as **white-box reuse**. The term "white-box" refers to *visibility*: With inheritance, the internals of parent classes are often visible to subclasses.

Object composition is an alternative to class inheritance. Here, new functionality is obtained by assembling or composing objects to get more complex functionality.
Object composition requires that the objects being composed have *well-defined interfaces*. This style of reuse is called **black-box reuse**, because no internal details of objects are visible. Objects appear only as "black boxes."

#### advantages
Class inheritance:
1. defined statically at compile-time and is straightforward to use;
2. makes it easier to modify the implementation being reused by overridden operations;

Object composition :
1. defined dynamically at run-time through objects acquiring references to other objects.
2. requires objects to respect each others' interfaces, which in turn requires carefully designed interfaces that *don't stop you from using one object with many others*.
3. Because objects are accessed *solely through their interfaces*, we **don't break encapsulation**. *Any object can be replaced at run-time by another as long as it has the same type*. 
4. Moreover, because an object's implementation will be written in terms of object interfaces, there are substantially *fewer implementation dependencies*.

Favoring object composition over class inheritance helps you *keep each class encapsulated and focused on one task*. Your classes and class hierarchies will remain small and will be less likely to grow into unmanageable monsters.

#### disadvantages
1.  you *can't change the implementations* inherited from parent classes *at run-time* ;
2.  generally worse, *parent classes often define at least part of their subclasses' physical representation.* Because inheritance exposes to a subclass the details of its parent's implementation, it's often said that "**inheritance breaks encapsulation(继承破坏封装)**"；
3.  Implementation dependencies can cause problems when you're trying to reuse a subclass. If any aspect of the inherited implementation not be appropriate for new problem domains, the *parent class must be rewritten or replaced* by something more appropriate. This dependency *limits flexibility and ultimately reusability*. 
One cure for this is to **inherit only from abstract classes**, since they usually provide little or no implementation.

#### 注意
- You shouldn't have to create new components to achieve reuse. You should be able to get all the functionality you need just by assembling existing components through object composition.
- Reuse by inheritancemakesit easier to make new components that can be composed with old ones. Inheritance and object composition thus work together.
- *Favor object composition over class inheritance*.


### 委托（Delegation）

Delegation is a way of making composition as powerful for reuse as inheritance。

In delegation, two objects are involved in handling a request: 
- a **receiving object** delegates operations to its **delegate**（委托人）. This is analogous（like） to *subclasses deferring(delay) requests to parent classes*. 
- But with inheritance, an *inherited operation* can always *refer to the receiving object* through the **this**（this pointer） member variable in C++ and Java. To achieve the same effect with delegation, the **receiver passes itself to the delegate** to let the delegated operation refer to the receiver.
- **Inheritance ： is-a**  **Delegation：have-a**

**Advantage**
The main advantage of delegation is that it makes it easy to compose behaviors at run-time and to change the way they're composed。
Our window（have a Rectangle instance） can become circular at run-time simply by replacing its Rectangleinstance with a Circle instance, assuming *Rectangle and Circle have the same type*.

**Disadvantage**
Delegation has a disadvantage itshares with other techniques that make software more flexible through object composition: Dynamic, highly parameterized software is *harder to understand than more static software*.


#### 相关的设计模式
Several design patterns use delegation. 
1. In the State pattern, an object delegates requests to a State object that represents its current state. 
2. In the Strategy pattern, an object delegates a specific request to an object thatrepresents a strategyfor carrying out the request. An object will only have one state, but it can have many strategies for different requests. The purpose of both patternsis to change the behavior of an object by changing the objects to which it delegates requests. 
3. In Visitor,the operation that gets performed on each element of an object structure is always delegated to the Visitor object. 

Other patterns use delegation less heavily. 
1. Mediator introduces an objectto mediate communicationbetween other objects. Sometimes the Mediator object implements operations simply by forwarding them to the other objects;other timesit passes along a referenceto itself and thus usestrue delegation. 
2. Chain ofResponsibility  handles requests by forwardingthem from one object to another along a chain of objects. Sometimes this request carries with it a reference to the original object receiving the request, in which case the pattern is using delegation. 
3. Bridge  decouples an abstraction from its implementation.Ifthe abstraction and a particular implementation are closely matched, then the abstraction may simply delegate operationsto that implementation.

### 继承 vs. 参数化类型
Another (not strictly object-oriented) technique for reusing functionality is through **parameterized types**, also known as **generics** (Java) and **templates** (C++). 
This technique lets you define a type without specifying all the other types it uses. The unspecified types are supplied as parameters at the point of use. 

Parameterized types give us a **third way (in addition to class inheritance and object composition) to compose behavior in object-oriented systems**. 
*Many designs can be implemented using any of these three techniques*. 
排序程序的 compare() 操作，有以下实现方式：
1. an operation **implemented by subclasses（交由子类实现--Inheritance）** (an application of Template Method );
2. **responsibility of an object that's passed to the sorting program（作为传递给排序程序的一个对象的职责--composition）** (Strategy);
3. an argument of a C++ template or Java generic that **specifies the name of the function（Method）（用参数指定采用的 compare() 方法-- parameterized types）** to call to compare the elements.

There are **important differences** between these techniques. 
- Object composition lets you change the behavior being composed at run-time, but it also requires indirection and can be less efficient. 
- Inheritance lets you provide default implementations for operations and lets subclasses override them. 
- Parameterized typeslet you change the types that a class can use. But neither inheritance nor parameterized types can change at run-time. Which approach is best depends on your design and implementation constraints. 

None of the patterns in this book concerns parameterized types, though we use them on occasion to customize a pattern's C++implementation.

## Run-Time and Compile-Time Structures
An object-oriented program's run-time structure often bears little resemblance to its code structure.

Many design patterns (inparticular those that have object scope) capture the distinction between compile-time and run-time structures explicitly.
1. Composite and Decorator  are especially useful for building complex run-time structures；
2. Observer involves run-time structures that are often hard to understand unless you know the pattern；
3. Chain of Responsibility  also results in communication patterns that inheritance doesn't reveal.
