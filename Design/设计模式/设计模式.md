# 概述


We classify design patterns by two criteria (Table 1.1).The first criterion, called purpose, reflects what a pattern does. Patterns can have either creational,structural, orbehavioral purpose. Creational patterns concern the process of object creation. Structural patterns deal with the composition of classes or objects. Behavioral patterns characterize the ways in which classes or objects interact and distribute responsibility. The second criterion, called scope, specifies whether the pattern applies primarily to classes or to objects. Class patterns deal with relationships between classes and their subclasses. These relationships are established through inheritance, so they are static— fixed at compile-time. Object patterns deal with object relationships, which can be changed at run-time and are more dynamic. Almost all patterns use inheritance to some extent. So the only patterns labeled "class patterns" are those that focus on class relationships. Note that most patterns are in the Object scope.

# 创建型
- Abstract Factory: Provide an interface for creating families ofrelated or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. 
- Adapter:  Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. 
- Bridge: Decouple an abstraction from itsimplementation so that the two can vary independently. 
- Builder: Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations. 
- Chain of Responsibility: Avoid coupling the sender of a request to itsreceiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it. 
- Command:  Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations. 
- Composite: Compose objectsinto tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. 
- Decorator: Attachadditional responsibilitiesto an objectdynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. 
- Facade: Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interfacethat makes the subsystem easier to use. 
- Factory Method: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
- Flyweight:  Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently. 
- Interpreter: Given a language, define a represention for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language. 
- Iterator: Provide a way to accessthe elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. 
- Observer:  Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updatedautomatically. 
- Prototype:  Specify the kinds of objectsto create using a prototypicalinstance, and create new objectsby copying this prototype. 
- Proxy: Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. 
- Singleton: Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it. 
- State: Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class. 
- Strategy: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategyletsthe algorithm vary independently from clientsthat use it. 
- Template Method: Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. TemplateMethod lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm'sstructure. 
- Visitor: Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitorlets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
