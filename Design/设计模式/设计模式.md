# 概述


- Abstract Factory: Provide an interface for creating families ofrelated or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. 
- Adapter:  Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. 
- Bridge: Decouple an abstraction from itsimplementation so that the two can vary independently. 
- Builder: Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations. 
- Chain of Responsibility: Avoid coupling the sender of a request to itsreceiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it. 
- Command:  Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations. 
- Composite: Compose objectsinto tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. Decorator (175) Attachadditional responsibilitiesto an objectdynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. Facade (185) Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interfacethat makes the subsystem easier to use. Factory Method (107) Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses
