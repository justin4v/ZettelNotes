# connection reset by peer 
- The remote server has sent you a **RST packet**, which indicates an immediate dropping of the connection, rather than the usual handshake. 
- This bypasses the normal **half-closed state transition**。
- It cannot be called 'connection reset by server' because it **can be sent by the client or the server**.
- 如果一端的 Socket 被关闭（或主动关闭，或因为异常退出而 引起的关闭），另一端仍发送数据，发送的第一个数据包引发该异常(Connect reset by peer)
- **Peer** ：a person who is the same age or who has the same social status as you。同龄人
