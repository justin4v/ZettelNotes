# 什么是编译器

Wiki Compiler 

> A compiler is a computer program (or a set of programs) that transforms source code written in a programming language (the source language) into another computer language (the target language)，with the latter often having a binary form known as object code. 
> The most common reason for converting source code is to create an executable program.

> 编译器是一种计算机程序，负责把一种编程语言编写的源码转换成另外一种计算机代码，后者往往是以二进制的形式被称为目标代码(object code)。
> 这个转换的过程通常的目的是生成可执行的程序。  

- Compiler 的产出是「另外一种代码」；
- 该代码等着被别人拿来执行，如果还不能直接被执行，那么还需要再编译或解释一遍，再交由计算机硬件执行。  
- 编译器，往往是在「执行」之前完成，产出是一种可执行或需要再编译或者解释的「代码」。

# 什么是解释器
Wiki Interpreter 

>In computer science, an interpreter is a computer program that directly executes, i.e. performs, instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without previously compiling them into a machine language program. An interpreter generally uses one of the following strategies for program execution:  
>1. parse the source code and perform its behavior directly.  
>2. translate source code into some efficient intermediate representation and immediately execute this.  
>3. explicitly execute stored precompiled code made by a compiler which is part of the interpreter system.

> 在计算机科学中，解释器是一种计算机程序，它直接执行由编程语言或脚本语言编写的代码，并不会把源代码预编译成机器码。
> 一个解释器，通常会用以下的姿势来执行程序代码：  
> 1. 分析源代码，并且直接执行。  
> 2. 把源代码翻译成相对更加高效率的中间码，然后立即执行它。  
> 3. 执行由解释器内部的编译器预编译后保存的代码  

- 可把解释器看成一个黑盒子，输入源码，会实时返回结果。  
- 不同类型的解释器，黑盒子的构造不一样，有些还会集成编译器，缓存编译结果，用来提高执行效率（例如 Chrome V8 也是这么做的）。  
- 解释器通常是工作在「运行时」，并且对于输入的源码，一行一行的解释然后执行，然后返回结果。

# 比较

## 表现 Behavior
- 编译器把源代码转换成其他的更低级的代码(例如二进制码、机器码)，但是不会执行它。  
- 解释器会读取源代码，并且直接生成指令让计算机硬件执行，不会输出另外一种代码。

## 性能 Performance
- 编译器会事先用比较多的时间把整个程序的源代码编译成另外一种代码，后者往往较前者更加接近机器码，所以执行的效率会更加高。时间是消耗在预编译的过程中。  
- 解释器会一行一行的读取源代码，解释，然后立即执行。这中间往往使用相对简单的词法分析、语法分析，压缩解释的时间，最后生成机器码，交由硬件执行。解释器适合比较低级的语言。但是相对于预编译好的代码，效率往往会更低。如何减少解释的次数和复杂性，是提高解释器效率的难题。  

## Compiler
### 优点
1.  Because they can see all the code up-front, they can perform a number of analyses and optimizations when generating code that makes the final version of the code executed faster than just interpreting each line individually.
    
2.  Compilers can often generate low-level code that performs the equivalent of a high-level ideas like "dynamic dispatch" or "inheritance" in terms of memory lookups inside of tables. This means that the resulting programs need to remember less information about the original code, lowering the memory usage of the generated program.
    
3.  Compiled code is generally faster than interpreted code because the instructions executed are usually just for the program itself, rather than the program itself plus the overhead from an interpreter.

### 缺点
1.  Some language features, such as dynamic typing, are difficult to compile efficiently because the compiler can't predict what's going to happen until the program is actually run. This means that the compiler might not generate very good code.
2.  Compilers generally have a long "start-up" time because of the cost of doing all the analysis that they do. This means that in settings like web browsers where it's important to load code fast, compilers might be slower because they optimize short code that won't be run many times.

## Interpreter
### 优点
1.  Because they can read the code as written and don't have to do expensive operations to generate or optimize code, they tend to start up faster than compilers.
    
2.  Because interpreters can see what the program does as its running, interpreters can use a number of dynamic optimizations that compilers might not be able to see.

### 缺点
1.  Interpreters typically have higher memory usage than compilers because the interpreter needs to keep more information about the program available at runtime.
    
2.  Interpreters typically spend some CPU time inside of the code for the interpreter, which can slow down the program being run.

# 实际使用
## Java
- Because interpreters and compilers have complementary strengths and weaknesses, it's becoming increasingly common for language runtimes to combine elements of both. 
- Java's JVM is a good example of this - the Java code itself is compiled, and initially it's interpreted. The JVM can then find code that's run many, many times and compile it directly to machine code, meaning that "hot" code gets the benefits of compilation while "cold" code does not. 
- The JVM can also perform a number of dynamic optimizations like inline caching to speed up performance in ways that compilers typically don't.


## Javascript
- Many modern JavaScript implementations use similar tricks. 
- Most JavaScript code is short and doesn't do all that much, so they typically start off using an interpreter. 
- However, if it becomes clear that the code is being run repeatedly, many JS engines will compile the code - or at least, compile bits and pieces of it - and optimize it using standard techniques. 
- The net result is that the code is fast at startup (useful for loading web pages quickly) but gets faster the more that it runs.

## Conclusion
One last detail is that _languages_ are not compiled or interpreted. 
Usually, C code is compiled, but there are C interpreters available that make it easier to debug or visualize the code that's being run (they're often used in introductory programming classes - or at least, they used to be.) 
JavaScript used to be thought of as an interpreted language until some JS engines started compiling it. 
Some Python implementations are purely interpreters, but you can get Python compilers that generate native code. 
Now, some languages are _easier_ to compile or interpret than others, but there's nothing stopping you from making a compiler or interpreter for any particular programming language. 
There's a theoretical result called the [Futamura projections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_evaluation#Futamura_projections) that shows that anything that can be interpreted can be compiled, for example.


## 相关概念

### 高级编程语言 High-Level Programming Language
- 高级编程语言，对计算机的细节有更高层次的抽象。  
- 相对于低级编程语言（low-level programming language）更接近自然语言（人类的语言），更易用。  

### 低级编程语言 Low-Level Programming Language

- 低级编程语言，相对高级语言，少了更多的抽象概念，更加接近于汇编或者机器指令。  
- 代码的可移植性很差。
- 有时描述为 “更接近硬件（close to hardware）”

### 汇编语言 Assembly Language

- 汇编语言作为一门低级语言，对应于计算机或者其他可编程的硬件。  
- 它和计算机的体系结构以及机器指令是强关联的。  
- 不同的汇编语言代码对应特定的硬件，所以不用谈可移植性了。  
- 相对于需要编译和解释的高级语言代码来说，汇编代码只需要翻译成机器码就可以执行了。  
- 汇编语言也往往被称作象征性机器码(symbolic machine code)

### 字节码 Byte Code

- 字节码严格来说不算是编程语言，而是高级编程语言为了种种需求（可移植性、可传输性、预编译等）而产生的中间码（Intermediate Code）。  
- 由一堆指令集组成的代码，例如在javac编译过后的java源码产生的就是字节码。  

### 机器码 Machine Code

机器码是一组可以直接被CPU执行的指令集，  
每一条指令都代表一个特定的任务，或者是加载，或者是跳转，亦或是计算操作等等。  
所有可以直接被CPU执行的程序，都是由这么一系列的指令组成的。  
机器码可是看作是编译过程中，最低级的代码，因外再往下就是交由硬件来执行了。  
机器码也是可以被编辑的。
