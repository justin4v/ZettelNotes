# Threadsafe
A data type or static method is _threadsafe_ if it *behaves correctly when used from multiple threads, regardless of how those threads are executed, and without demanding additional coordination from the calling code*.

-  “Behaves correctly” means satisfying its specification and preserving its response invariant.
-   “Regardless of how threads are executed” means threads might be on multiple processors or timesliced on the same processor.
-   And “without additional coordination” means that the data type can’t put preconditions on its caller related to timing, like “you can’t call `get()` while `set()` is in progress.”
